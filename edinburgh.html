    <p class="lead"> From the medieval tenements, vennels and wynds of the Old Town to the elegance and grace of the Georgian New Town, Edinburgh thoroughly deserves its reputation as one of the most beautiful and fascinating cities in the world.
Built on a human scale and easily navigated, Edinburgh readily gives up its secrets but has more to offer than just history written in stone. It’s a cosmopolitan city too, with Michelin-starred restaurants, a thriving café culture, vibrant and varied nightlife, great shopping and a strong contemporary arts scene.
Of course, you can’t think of Edinburgh without thinking of the International Festival and Fringe, but it’s not just a summer city. As the days shorten it lights up for Christmas and Hogmanay celebrations, but with festivals—from film to jazz to food and beyond— happening every month of the year, there’s no off season in Edinburgh.</p>
